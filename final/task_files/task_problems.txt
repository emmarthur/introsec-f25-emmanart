A small music company was recently hit by a threat actor.
The company's Art Directory, Larry, claims to have discovered a random note on his Desktop.

Given that they are just starting, they did not have time to properly set up the appropriate tools for capturing artifacts. Their IT contact only set up Wireshark, which captured the events in question.
